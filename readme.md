# Google Reader Lite

**Note:** This project is defunct, just like Google Reader.

Google Reader Lite is a [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net) script that removes the clutter and social networking cruft (a.k.a. Google+) from [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/). <strong>Updated for 2011 redesign.</strong></p>

### What it gets rid of

- +1
- following
- sharing / requests
- trends
- “browse for stuff”
- recommendations
- tags
- e-mailing

### What it keeps

- reading
- searching
- starring
- “send to” (for [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com))

### Use it

Google Reader Lite requires Greasemonkey, GreaseKit, Google Chrome, or any Greasemonkey-compatible userscript tool.
